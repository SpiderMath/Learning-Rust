// Main is the main function, which is run all the other functions can be called from here, fn is for declaring the function
fn main() {
    println!("Jello World!");
    // println! -> Prints to the console on the next Line, the ! is important, since it is a 'macro' [What's that tho]
    print!("Jell World! x2!");
    // print! -> Prints to the console, but does not move the curson to the next line, ! is important (again)
}
